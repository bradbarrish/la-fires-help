It has been frustratingly difficult to find high-quality, trustworthy information in a single place as things have unfolded with the fires, so this is an attempt to make it a little easier for anyone impacted by the fires. As much as possible I have tried to vet the information and only include informational resources that have cited sources or were written by subjectmatter experts.

I created [a custom GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-678a7b3ebf648191a203f5d964cdf12d-post-la-fires-gpt) that is an expert in air quality and can answer all of your questions about life in LA post-fire. You can ask it anything about air quality, health, and safety. I have tested it extensively and it is very good. Others have told me the same.
