It has been frustratingly difficult to find high-quality, trustworthy information in a single place as things have unfolded with the fires, so this is an attempt to make it a little easier for anyone impacted by the fires. As much as possible I have tried to vet the information and only include informational resources that have cited sources or were written by subjectmatter experts.
