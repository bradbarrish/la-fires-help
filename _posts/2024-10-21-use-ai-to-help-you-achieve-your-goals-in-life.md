description: I mostly use ChatGPT and Claude as thought partners more than anything else. I came across a prompt that someone posted somewhere and made it my own. Sorry, I don't recall where I came across the post that inspired this. If I find it, I'll add attribution to the post.

As of October 21, 2024, I continue to get better answers from Claude, so unless I've said otherwise since, I recommend Claude for stuff like this.

Before you do this, you'll want to give some thought to what you want in your life. Or don't give it a lot of thought. If you want to see what kind of answers you get, you can always come up with a directionally correct list and iterate. Keep in mind, you can write this on paper or in a journal of some kind, take a photo of it and upload it to Claude.

```
Here is everything I want in my life. Please put together a life plan to hit this in X years. Please ask questions, especially if asking them will help you come up with the best plan.
```

You could use this prompt for a single goal too. Let's say you wanted to reduce your family's spending. As long as you had a list of the main things that you were spending money on, you could use a prompt like this to help put together a plan.

```
Here is a list of the main things my family spends money on. We want to reduce our spending by X% (or some absolute amount). Please put together a plan to hit this goal over the next X months. If there is other information that would be helpful for you to make the plan the best it can be, please ask. 
```

Of course you still have to be accountable and do the work, but AI chatbots like Claude and ChatGPT remain exceptional, nonjudgemental thinking partners and collaborators for stuff like this.
