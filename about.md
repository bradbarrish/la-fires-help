ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Brad and this is where I post all of my public documentation. It's hosted with GitHub Pages and uses a lightly edited version of [Clio by Dan Romero](https://github.com/danromero/clio). I have [a blog](https://bradbarrish.com/) and [a microblog](https://micro.bradbarrish.com/). Feel free to email me at my first name at my full name dot com.
